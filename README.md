# Netflix Homepage Development Intern Application

Hello, Bharatintern Team! My name is Yogesh T, and I am applying for the Netflix Homepage Development Intern position. Below, you will find details about the project I have created as part of my application.

## Project Description

I have developed a simplified version of the Netflix homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills in frontend web development and my ability to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
